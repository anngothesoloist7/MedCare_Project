📌 Project Title: **MedCare**

📄 Brief Description of your system and the problem it solves
**MedCare** is an AI powered patient care system designed to remove the heavy admin work doctors usually rely on nurses for. Doctors speak naturally to record diagnoses, prescriptions, and treatment notes, and the system converts that voice input into structured data stored securely. Patients can log in to track their medications, check usage instructions, and receive updates, while doctors stay informed through real time summaries and alerts. MedCare creates a smoother, more efficient workflow for both patients and clinicians
